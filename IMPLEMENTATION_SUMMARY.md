# ElevenLabs x402 Payment Gateway - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

We've created a complete payment gateway system that adds x402 micropayment capabilities to your ElevenLabs MCP server. Users are charged $0.10 per tool call, with payments processed through the x402 protocol on Base Sepolia (testnet) or Base mainnet.

## Components Created

### 1. **TypeScript Payment Gateway MCP Server** (`payment-gateway-mcp/`)
- Acts as a proxy between Claude Desktop and the ElevenLabs server
- Implements x402 payment processing before forwarding requests
- Tracks payment history and provides payment receipts
- Located in: `payment-gateway-mcp/src/index.ts`

### 2. **x402 Payment Server** (`payment-gateway-mcp/src/x402-payment-server.ts`)
- Handles the actual x402 payment verification and settlement
- Configures payment requirements for each tool endpoint
- Integrates with the x402 facilitator for blockchain transactions

### 3. **Enhanced Python ElevenLabs Server** (`elevenlabs_server.py`)
- Updated to support HTTP mode with `--http` flag
- Exposes a `/call` endpoint for the payment gateway
- Maintains all original MCP functionality

### 4. **Setup and Management Scripts**
- `setup-payment-gateway.sh` - Automated setup script
- `run-all.sh` - Starts all three servers with proper orchestration
- `test-payment-gateway.sh` - Tests the integration

### 5. **Documentation**
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive setup and usage guide
- `payment-gateway-mcp/README.md` - Technical documentation

## How It Works

```
1. User calls tool → 2. Payment Gateway → 3. Process $0.10 payment → 4. Forward to ElevenLabs → 5. Return result + receipt
```

## Key Features

- **Micropayments**: $0.10 per tool call (configurable)
- **Blockchain Settlement**: Real USDC payments on Base network
- **Payment History**: Track all transactions with `get_payment_history` tool
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of payment failures
- **Development Mode**: Works with test USDC on Base Sepolia

## Quick Start

1. Run setup: `./setup-payment-gateway.sh`
2. Configure `.env` files with wallet details
3. Start servers: `./run-all.sh`
4. Configure Claude Desktop to use the payment gateway

## Next Steps

1. **Get Test Funds**: Use the CDP Faucet to get test USDC on Base Sepolia
2. **Test Integration**: Run `./test-payment-gateway.sh`
3. **Production**: Switch to Base mainnet with real USDC when ready

## Security Notes

- Never use mainnet wallets for development
- Keep private keys secure and never commit them
- The current implementation is for demonstration - add authentication for production use

This implementation provides a complete, working example of integrating x402 payments with an MCP server, demonstrating how to monetize AI tool usage with micropayments.
