REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 27 April 2016
on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1)

The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right.
Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right to the protection of
personal data concerning him or her.

(2)

The principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal
data should, whatever their nationality or residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular
their right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of
an area of freedom, security and justice and of an economic union, to economic and social progress, to the
strengthening and the convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being of natural
persons.

(3)

Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the protection of
fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow
of personal data between Member States.

(4)

The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal
data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against
other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all
fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the
Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of
personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to
conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic
diversity.

(5)

The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial
increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actors,
including natural persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities in
the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able
to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.

(6)

Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal
data. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both
private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to
pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally.
Technology has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of
personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring
a high level of the protection of personal data.

(7)

Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by
strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop
across the internal market. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical
certainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced.

(8)

Where this Regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States
may, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to
whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into their national law.

(9)

The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the
implementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that
there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity.
Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the
protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the
free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the
pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the
discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the
existence of differences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.

(10)

In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to
flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons
with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and
homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural
persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the
processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in
the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be
allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this
Regulation. In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive
95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This
Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the
processing of special categories of personal data (‘sensitive data’). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude
Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more
precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.

(11)

Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of
the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal
data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of
personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States.

(12)

Article 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free
movement of personal data.

(13)

In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent
divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary
to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights
and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the
processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation
between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market
requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons
connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account
of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for
organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions
and bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific
needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro,
small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation
2003/361/EC (1).

(14)

The protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of
residence, in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not cover the processing of
personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons, including
the name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person.

(15)

In order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of natural persons should be technolo­
gically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to
the processing of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the personal data are
contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages,
which are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.

(16)

This Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of
personal data related to activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national
security. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying
out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union.

(17)

Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) applies to the processing of
personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other
Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data should be adapted to the principles and rules
established in this Regulation and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and
coherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001
should follow after the adoption of this Regulation, in order to allow application at the same time as this
Regulation.

(18)

This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely
personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or

(2) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8,
12.1.2001, p. 1).

L 119/4

household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online
activity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this Regulation applies to controllers or
processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities.

(19)

The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the
purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of
criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free
movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply
to processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under this
Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely
Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Member States may entrust
competent authorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily
carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the
execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so
that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law,
falls within the scope of this Regulation.

With regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope
of this Regulation, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the
application of the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements
for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account
the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the
processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should
provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and
rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to
safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or
prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the
prevention of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering
or the activities of forensic laboratories.

(20)

While this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial authorities, Union or
Member State law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the
processing of personal data by courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory
authorities should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their judicial capacity, in
order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks, including decisionmaking. It should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within
the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this
Regulation, enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and
handle complaints in relation to such data processing operations.

(21)

This Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council (2), in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that
Directive. That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by ensuring the free
movement of information society services between Member States.

(22)

Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor
in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself
takes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable
arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal
personality, is not the determining factor in that respect.

(1) Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or
prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data and repealing Council
Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (see page 89 of this Official Journal).
(2) Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society
services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’) (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1).

(23)

In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this
Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor
not established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to
offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to
determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the
Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services
to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's,
processor's or an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use
of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain
such intention, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States
with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or
users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data
subjects in the Union.

(24)

The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not
established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the
behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine
whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be
ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal
data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions
concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.

(25)

Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a
controller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post.

(26)

The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural
person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by
the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To
determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to
be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly
or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account
should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification,
taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.
The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information
which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in
such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern
the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes.

(27)

This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules
regarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons.

(28)

The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and
help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of ‘pseudony­
misation’ in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection.

(29)

In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymi­
sation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has
taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this
Regulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data
subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons
within the same controller.

L 119/6

Official Journal of the European Union

4.5.2016

(30)

Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and
protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency
identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other
information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.

(31)

Public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of
their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent adminis­
trative authorities, or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities
markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a
particular inquiry in the general interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for
disclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not
concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal
data by those public authorities should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the
purposes of the processing.

(32)

Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and
unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her,
such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a
box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another
statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed
processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute
consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the
processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be
given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive
to the use of the service for which it is provided.

(33)

It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at
the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of
scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should
have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the
extent allowed by the intended purpose.

(34)

Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a
natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in
particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of
another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained.

(35)

Personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which
reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This
includes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or the provision of,
health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) to
that natural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural
person for health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily
substance, including from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease,
disability, disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data
subject independent of its source, for example from a physician or other health professional, a hospital, a medical
device or an in vitro diagnostic test.

(36)

The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the
Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another
establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be

(1) Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in
cross‑border healthcare (OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45).

4.5.2016

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 119/7

the main establishment. The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to
objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main
decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not
depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of
technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves,
constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main
establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no
central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In
cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain
the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the
supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that
supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any
case, the supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more
establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision
concerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main
establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of
undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking.

(37)

A group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the
controlling undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over the other
undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it or the
power to have personal data protection rules implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of
personal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings, as a group of
undertakings.

(38)

Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks,
consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such
specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of
marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children
when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be
necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child.

(39)

Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that
personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the
personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communi­
cation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear
and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the
identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and
transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and
communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made
aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their
rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed
should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal
data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed.
This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict
minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be
fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits
should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable step should be taken
to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a
manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing
unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing.

(40)

In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data
subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or

L 119/8

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

4.5.2016

Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal
obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data
subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.

(41)

Where this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative
act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the
Member State concerned. However, such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its
application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice
of the European Union (the ‘Court of Justice’) and the European Court of Human Rights.

(42)

Where processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the
data subject has given consent to the processing operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration
on another matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to
which consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC (1) a declaration of consent preformulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain
language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at
least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are
intended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is
unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.

(43)

In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing
of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in
particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in
all the circumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow
separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the
individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the
consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.

(44)

Processing should be lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to enter into a
contract.

(45)

Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where
processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official authority, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not
require a specific law for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a
legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task
carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also be for
Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the
general conditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications
for determining the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects
concerned, the entities to which the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period
and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State law to
determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
authority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where it is
in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the
management of health care services, by private law, such as a professional association.

(46)

The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest
which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data

based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing
cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both important grounds
of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for
humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian
emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters.

(47)

The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be
disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable
expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest could exist
for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in
situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of
a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the
time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place.
The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data
controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect
further processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to
process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public authorities in the
performance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing
fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal data for
direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.

(48)

Controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a
legitimate interest in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative
purposes, including the processing of clients' or employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfer
of personal data, within a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain unaffected.

(49)

The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring
network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level
of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity,
integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered
by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by computer emergency response teams
(CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications
networks and services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of
the data controller concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic
communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping ‘denial of service’ attacks and damage to
computer and electronic communication systems.

(50)

The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected
should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were
initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal
data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and
specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful.
Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided
by Union or Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further
processing. In order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for
which the personal data are initially collected, the controller, after having met all the requirements for the
lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and
the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been collected, in
particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their

L 119/10

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

4.5.2016

further use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data
subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing
operations.

Where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which
constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important
objectives of general public interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data
irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application of the principles set out in this
Regulation and in particular the information of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights
including the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security by
the controller and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the
same criminal act or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the
legitimate interest pursued by the controller. However, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the
controller or further processing of personal data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a
legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy.

(51)

Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms
merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights
and freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use
of the term ‘racial origin’ in this Regulation does not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which
attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should not systemati­
cally be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of
biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or
authentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in
specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific
provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance
with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general
principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful
processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data
should be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of
specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain
associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.

(52)

Derogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be allowed when
provided for in Union or Member State law and subject to suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and
other fundamental rights, where it is in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal data in the
field of employment law, social protection law including pensions and for health security, monitoring and alert
purposes, the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a
derogation may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management of health-care
services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims
for benefits and services in the health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derogation should also allow the processing of such
personal data where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court
proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.

(53)

Special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes
only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in
particular in the context of the management of health or social care services and systems, including processing
by the management and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control,
management information and the general national and local supervision of the health or social care system, and
ensuring continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert
purposes, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for
studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation should provide for
harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data concerning health, in respect of
specific needs, in particular where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes

4.5.2016

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 119/11

by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union or Member State law should provide for
specific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons.
Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard
to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the
free flow of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border processing of such data.

(54)

The processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas
of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should be subject to suitable and specific
measures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In that context, ‘public health’ should be
interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1),
namely all elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants
having an effect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and
universal access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such
processing of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being
processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies.

(55)

Moreover, the processing of personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims, laid down
by constitutional law or by international public law, of officially recognised religious associations, is carried out
on grounds of public interest.

(56)

Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires
that political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be
permitted for reasons of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.

(57)

If the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data
controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the
sole purpose of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller should not refuse to
take additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights.
Identification should include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication
mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to the on-line service offered by the
data controller.

(58)

The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be
concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where
appropriate, visualisation be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when
addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of
actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand
whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the
case of online advertising. Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication,
where processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily
understand.

(59)

Modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation,
including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification
or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for
requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed by electronic means. The
controller should be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest
within one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests.

(1) Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on Community statistics on public
health and health and safety at work (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 70).

(60)

The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the
processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further
information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances
and context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the
existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal data are collected from the
data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data
and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in
combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner, a
meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be
machine-readable.

(61)

The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him
or her at the time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another
source, within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be
legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first
disclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that
for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with
information on that other purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data
cannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be
provided.

(62)

However, it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already
possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law
or where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a dispropor­
tionate effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in
the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of
data subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration.

(63)

A data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her,
and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of
the processing. This includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for
example the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results,
assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided. Every data subject should
therefore have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which
the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the
recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when
based on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller should be able to provide
remote access to a secure system which would provide the data subject with direct access to his or her personal
data. That right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual
property and in particular the copyright protecting the software. However, the result of those considerations
should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes a large
quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller should be able to request that, before the
information is delivered, the data subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request
relates.

(64)

The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in
particular in the context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not retain personal data for
the sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests.

(65)

A data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a ‘right to be
forgotten’ where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the
controller is subject. In particular, a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased
and no longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which
they are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to
the processing of personal data concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does
not otherwise comply with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given

4.5.2016

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 119/13

his or her consent as a child and is not fully aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to
remove such personal data, especially on the internet. The data subject should be able to exercise that right
notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child. However, the further retention of the personal data
should be lawful where it is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for
compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public
health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

(66)

To strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in
such a way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to inform the controllers
which are processing such personal data to erase any links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In
doing so, that controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology and the means
available to the controller, including technical measures, to inform the controllers which are processing the
personal data of the data subject's request.

(67)

Methods by which to restrict the processing of personal data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the
selected data to another processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or temporarily
removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems, the restriction of processing should in
principle be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further
processing operations and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data is restricted should
be clearly indicated in the system.

(68)

To further strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal data is carried out
by automated means, the data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concerning him or her
which he or she has provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable
format, and to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable
formats that enable data portability. That right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on
the basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. It should not
apply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right
should not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. It
should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal
obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data subject's right to transmit or receive
personal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain
processing systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal data, more than one
data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and
freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice
the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in
this Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject
which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as
the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject
should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another.

(69)

Where personal data might lawfully be processed because processing is necessary for the performance of a task
carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, or on grounds of
the legitimate interests of a controller or a third party, a data subject should, nevertheless, be entitled to object to
the processing of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation. It should be for the controller to
demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms
of the data subject.

(70)

Where personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data subject should have the right to
object to such processing, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing, whether
with regard to initial or further processing, at any time and free of charge. That right should be explicitly brought
to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly and separately from any other information.

L 119/14
(71)

4.5.2016

The data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating
personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal
effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online
credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention. Such processing includes ‘profiling’
that consists of any form of automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a
natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject's performance at work,
economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements,
where it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. However,
decision-making based on such processing, including profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorised by
Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring
and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards and recommendations of
Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by
the controller, or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data subject and a
controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit consent. In any case, such processing should be
subject to suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to
obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached
after such assessment and to challenge the decision. Such measure should not concern a child.

In order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into account the specific
circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed, the controller should use appropriate
mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures
appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and
the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks
involved for the interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory effects on
natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union
membership, genetic or health status or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect.
Automated decision-making and profiling based on special categories of personal data should be allowed only
under specific conditions.

(72)

Profiling is subject to the rules of this Regulation governing the processing of personal data, such as the legal
grounds for processing or data protection principles. The European Data Protection Board established by this
Regulation (the ‘Board’) should be able to issue guidance in that context.

(73)

Restrictions concerning specific principles and the rights of information, access to and rectification or erasure of
personal data, the right to data portability, the right to object, decisions based on profiling, as well as the
communication of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations of the controllers may
be imposed by Union or Member State law, as far as necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to
safeguard public security, including the protection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade
disasters, the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal
penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, or of breaches of
ethics for regulated professions, other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a
